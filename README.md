# COVID-19 Data SQL Exploration üè•

**Hello Readers**  
I sourced this dataset from Kaggle and loaded it into a SQL database to perform a full exploratory analysis using plain SQL. In the first part of the workflow, you‚Äôll see how to import and **clean** the raw data‚Äîan essential step before any querying. Then, in **SQL Covid.sql**, I‚Äôve written queries that demonstrate everything from basic aggregates to window functions, helping you uncover trends and insights in the COVID-19 data.

## üîç About

This project explores COVID-19 case data for India using only SQL. You‚Äôll learn how to load a CSV into your database, clean and standardize fields, then write queries to:

- Summarize total cases, recoveries, and deaths  
- Track daily and monthly trends  
- Identify the hardest-hit states and dates  
- Compute growth rates with window functions  
- Rank regions by case counts  

All queries live in the [SQL Covid.sql](https://github.com/karan2958/covid/blob/main/SQL%20Covid.sql) script.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Key fields** include:  
  - `Date`: observation date (YYYY-MM-DD)  
  - `State`: Indian state or union territory  
  - `Confirmed`: cumulative confirmed cases  
  - `Recovered`: cumulative recoveries  
  - `Deaths`: cumulative fatalities  
  - ‚Ä¶and other metadata columns

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

1. **Import** raw CSV into a staging table.  
2. **Trim** whitespace and **CAST** strings to dates and numbers.  
3. **Filter** out duplicates and NULLs.  
4. **Create** a final cleaned table for analysis.

_Clean data ensures accurate aggregates and window calculations!_

## ‚ú® SQL Analysis

In **SQL Covid.sql**, you‚Äôll find queries such as:

- **Descriptive Aggregates**:  
```  SELECT Date,
         SUM(Confirmed)   AS total_confirmed,
         SUM(Recovered)   AS total_recovered,
         SUM(Deaths)      AS total_deaths
    FROM covid_clean
   GROUP BY Date;```

- **State-wise Rankings:**:  

SELECT State,
       SUM(Confirmed) AS cases,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Confirmed) DESC) AS rank
  FROM covid_clean
 GROUP BY State;
